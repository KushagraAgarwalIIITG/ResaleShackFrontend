# Project Description
### Category
A Web Application
### Purpose
The purpose of this application is to help students buy and sell products within their campus at
ease; it is an online marketplace that helps students buy and sell second-hand products without
any hassle.
### Scope
Creating an online platform makes it easier for students to connect and find the right person who
could help them. The scope of an online marketplace is huge because every year new students are
enrolled into an institute, in turn increasing the need for such software. Convenience and quickness
are the most impressive advantages of the system. By reselling, it promotes the idea of reusability
and reduction of unnecessary items.
### Introduction
#### Proposed System
1. `Student Registration`: Students should register using the institute e-mail ID so that we can
verify.
2. `Select their role`: They can either put up an ad to sell a product or browse through the
existing ads.
3. `Search bar`: Once a student starts looking for a particular product, we provide them with
various filter options to specify their exact requirements.
4. `Categories`: We will include various categories from which they can choose
5. `Dashboard`: If a person wants to sell a product, they’ll have their dashboard, which has a
record of their previous and current ads; they can edit them according to their requirement.
6. `Ad Card`: It displays a brief description of the product while searching; one can click on it to
know more.
#### Advantages for Sellers
1. Easy to find prospective leads.
2. They are earning money by getting rid of the things they don’t need.
3. Zero shipping cost/tax of any sort, as the transaction, happens within the campus.
Advantages for Buyers
1. Buyers don’t have to spend a hefty amount of money to buy new things they only require for
a few years.
2. Getting access to reliable sellers as they are their seniors or batch mates.
3. Flexibility to verify the durability of the product by checking it then and there.
### Functional Requirements
1. All the products will be listed to be viewed in form of ***cards*** displaying the
picture, price, short description, the room number of the seller, days posted ago.
2. Users will be able to choose between the categories of the products listed the via **category**
***bar***.
3. Users will be able to search for products via the ***search bar***.
4. To become a seller, the user will be able to ***sign up*** with an email registered with the
college. A verification system will verify the student.
5. The seller must provide name, roll number, batch, phone number, registered email address,
and password during the signup up process.
6. Registered users will be able to ***upload ads*** for their products via a form having inputs for
 title, category, description, photos, and videos.
7. Registered users will be able to ***view, edit, delete*** all their listed product ads in a
dashboard .
8. A buyer can ***report an ad*** if they find it suspicious or fake. The administrators will then
access the reported ads and ***delete*** or ***discard*** them.
### Non-Functional Requirements
1. 24*7 availability
2. Secure access to consumers’ confidential data.
3. Better component design so that it is easy to identify any error if occurs or make required
changes.
4. Password encryption.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
